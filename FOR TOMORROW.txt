Okay so this is gonna be a quick briefing on what we're gonna do
We'll do a music player where you can put in your music and press play and do whatever
the catch is that the music you put in is analyzed by a recurrent neural network and it learns to generate music you like
Kiera and Jason do the front end stuff, allard does the presentation, i'll do the recurrent net


DEPENDENCIES
A list of python libraries you will need to use the recurrent neural network

0. Python 3
1. Anaconda takes care of most of these: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html
ADD THIS TO YOUR PATH. CLICK THE CHECKBOX.

2. Make sure that you configure the path appropriately so python's package manager pip can install to your conda distribution

1a and 2a. If you don't take the anaconda route you will need to google tensorflow's dependencies and install them

3. tensorflow
WINDOWS: py -m pip install tensorflow
OSX: pip install tensorflow
Additionally you can google the conda install commands through anaconda

4. keras
WINDOWS: py -m pip install keras
OSX: pip install keras
Additionally you can google the conda install commands through anaconda


Front end libraries you may find useful

0. Tkinter
GUI library for python, this is a dependency for some other stuff

1. Pygame
For games but you can use it for gui stuff and music players

2. Matplotlib
Maybe you wanna do some plotting
